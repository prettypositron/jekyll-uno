## SIR Model

The [SIR Model](http://mat.uab.cat/matmat/PDFv2013/v2013n03.pdf) is the most famous epidemiologic model. It considers the population that belongs to each of the following states:
1. Susceptible (S) - the individual has not contracted the disease, but the individual can be infected due to transmission from infected people.
2. Infected (I) - This person has contracted the disease.
3. Recovered/Deceased (R) - This person either survived, hence recovered, or has died, hence deceased.

β is the parameter for transmission rate, and γ is the recovery rate. On the right, you have ordinary differential equations that summarize this model in a short-term deterministic model. This ignores vital dynamics (ie. new births, for a growing population) so it is a closed population. 

The graph should make sense. Overtime, the number Susceptible (S) decreases, the number Recovered/Deceased (R) increases, and the number Infected (I) increases to a peak then drops back down. 

I solve the differential equations using a 4th order [Runge-Kutta method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods). 

I decided to change my model to the superior SEIR Model:

This has an "Exposed" compartment which is ideal for infections that have a significant incubation period during which individuals have been infected but are not yet infectious themselves.

α is the parameter for the average incubation, and μ is the death rate.

This is an excellent [SEIR-model calculator for COVID](http://gabgoh.github.io/COVID/index.html)

So to re-iterate:
1. S ==> Susceptible : number of susceptible
2. E ==> Expose : number of exposed
3. I ==> Infectious : number of infectious
4. R ==> Recovered or Removed : number recovered (or immune) individuals.
- We have S + E + I + R = N, this is only constant because of the (degenerate) assumption that birth and death rates are equal, N is country population.

There's also a few other variables:
- R_0 & R_t ==> [Reproduction number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number): The definition describes the state where no other individuals are infected or immunized (naturally or through vaccination)
- T_inf ==> Average duration of the infection, 1/T_inf can be treat as individual experiences one recovery in D units of time.
- T_inc ==> Average incubation period, Many paper and article define as 5.1 ([reference](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32150748), [reference2](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-incubation-period/))

The R_0 can decrease from intervention measures such as government isolation/lock-down, vaccinations, etc.

Here's an example of the SEIR model on Hubei without intervention:

Now, with intervention:

A substantial difference as you can see. 

In models with intervention, we can reduct R_t by using [differential decay functions](https://github.com/SwissTPH/openmalaria/wiki/ModelDecayFunctions), like the Hill Function.

![](https://github.com/SwissTPH/openmalaria/wiki/img/graphs/decay-functions.png)

The Hill Function represents a half-decay that never reaches zero due to its exponential nature.

I find that the average incubation period (T_inc) is 5.2, and the average infectious period (T_inf) is 2.9. 

As for R_t, I find this number by fitting the real data to the SEIR model's curve. Same goes for cfr, or Case Fatality Rate.

Given that the Hill Function involves the R_0 to half each time, that is what I set as the function for the total period of time that intervention is enforced. I think 80 days is a good average. 

So, once intervention begins, R0 = R0 * 0.5.

TL;DW (too long, didn't write especially considering the hour) so I'm just going to link my code here it's relatively self-explanatory.

Let's just throw some relevant forecasting curves up first:
