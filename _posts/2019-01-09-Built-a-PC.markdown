I could not resist building a new PC. I was meant to do this at the ML Neuro lab, however we ran into red tape regarding Columbia's IT Department and their contract with HP. Nonetheless, I had toxic assets (crypto) which many retailers accepted, which is folly. I long charted the price trends of various components, and made my purchases at a dip which was unsurprisingly during Black Friday.
