I could not resist building a new PC. I was meant to do this at the ML Neuro lab, however we ran into red tape regarding Columbia's IT Department and their contract with HP.

In other terms, it is simply value but for high performing components. 

Here are some visualizations that should make it clear as to how I made the right choice:

Bear in mind, this is the first time I have built a PC since I was 12 years old. 

I have to tutor, will continue this post later.
