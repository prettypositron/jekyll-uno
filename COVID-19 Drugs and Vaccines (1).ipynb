    "## Abstract\n",
    "This is my attempt to use both text and data mining techniques to build a comprehensive network of relationships between a complex and vast swathe of biological components. I use the CORD-19 corpus as well as MEDLINE. \n",
    " \n",
    "### Approach \n",
    "I use a version of NLP that supports real-time entity assisted search and navigation of the [MEDLINE](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/medline.html) repository while simultaneously using PubMed as the underlying search engine. This version is called [TPX](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22829734). TPX is a modular and versatile text-mininig framework designed for biomedical research. I am particularly using a pipeline called [PRIORI-T](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22829734) which is prioritized for phenotype-driven rare diseases. It functions by re-purposing specific modules of the TPX framework. These modules include:\n",
    "1. Dictionary Curation\n",
    "2. Annotator for entity annotations\n",
    "3. MEDLINE processor\n",
    "4. Network Creation module; functions to build a heterogenous network of the correlations extracted by the Correlation Extraction module\n",
    "5. Network Augmentation module; augments the network with novel links inferred from a graphic convolutional approach\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how I re-purposed it for CORD-19:\n",
    "1. I took the entirety of the CORD19 dataset corpus and filtered it for unique full-text articles, using the Corpus Processor module. I also included the complete MEDLINE abstracts which I used the network augmentation module for in order to augment the network with inferred novel connections.\n",
    "2. I used the Annotator module to annotate the corpus based on the following dictionaries: HUMAN_GENE, GENE_SARS, GENE_MERS, GENE_COVID, PHENOTYPE, CHEMICALS, DRUGS, DISEASE, SYMPTOM, GOPROC, GOFUNC, GOLOC, CELLTYPE, TISSUE, ANATOMY, ORGANISM, COUNTRIES, ETHICS TERMS (general terms related to human ethics), NON-PHARMA INTERVENTION (terms related to non-pharmaceutical intervention), SURVEILLANCE TERMS (general terms related to disease surveillance), VACCINE TERMS, VIROLOGY TERMS (general terms used in virology studies) and EARTH SCIENCE TERMS.\n",
    "3. I used the Correlation Extraction module to extract out correlations among these types which are then used by the Network Creation module to build a network that can be queried to obtain information from the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimatley, this will serve as a knowledge base that can help the COVID-19 research community to obtain useful insights spanning several complex entity types via a combination of text-mining and network analyses. \n",
    "\n",
    "### PyVis Visualization\n",
    "I used PyVis to construct and visualize an intuitive and interactive exploration of this system. Here's a schematic that outlines the overall approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://prettypositron.github.io/minimal/images/pipeline.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step-wise Details\n",
    "### Corpus preprocessing and augmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "**CORD-19 corpus preprocessing**\n",
    "As part of the corpus-preprocessing I removed unwanted characters such as white spaces and html codes. I de-duplicated the corpus to remove duplicate articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Incorrectly annotated COVID19 articles:**: I found this recurring sentence *\"publicly funded repositories, such as the WHO COVID database with rights for unrestricted research re-use and analyses in any form or by any means with acknowledgement of the original source. These permissions are granted for free by Elsevier for as long as the COVID-19 resource centre remains active.\"* at the begining of 380 articles sourced from Elsevier in the corpus. Many of these articles are actually not relevant to COVID-19 and seem to have come into the corpus because of this one sentence. In such articles, there is only a single mention of COVID-19 in the above sentence. I removed this sentence from the articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of focusing only on the \"title\" and \"abstract\" sections, I process the *COMPLETE* corpus of full-text articles. Only **Foreign Language Articles** were excluded from the corpus. The CORD-19 corpus contains full-text foreign language articles, including those in Spanish, French and German. While these did not adversely affect the overall quality of my system, a few false-positives were observed. Hence, we excluded a total of 854 such foreign language articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the clean-up, I segregated the article text into various spans, which included sentence, section, paragraph and the full article.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Augmenting the corpus with related MEDLINE abstracts**: While the provided CORD-19 corpus is an excellent source of COVID-19 articles, I experimented to see if there were any related MEDLINE abstracts that could possibly be added to the corpus to improve the precision and recall. Towards this, I filtered the entire tagged MEDLINE for abstracts containing the terms \"coronavirus infection\", SARS, MERS or COVID-19 or their synonyms. As a result, I identified a subset of MEDLINE abstracts that could be used to augment the CORD-19 corpus. **To reiterate**: the provided CORD-19 corpus is the principal data source for my system. However, I did find additional useful COVID-19 related abstracts in MEDLINE.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NER Annotator\n",
    "I used a lexicon (dictionary)-based NER annotator to tag the text. The annotator takes care of local abbreviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "After tagging, I used the **Conflict Resolver** to resolve conflicts arising from the same text getting annotated by different dictionaries. The order followed was \"DISEASE\" > \"SYMPTOM\" > \"PHENOTYPE\" > \"HGNC\" > \"GENE-COVID\" >\"GENE-SARS\" >\"GENE-MERS\" > \"VACCINETERMS\" > \"DRUGS\" > \"CHEMICALS\" > \"GO_PROCESS\" > \"GO_FUNCTION\" > \"GO_LOCATION\" > \"CELLTYPE\" > \"TISSUE\" > \"ANATOMY\" > \"VIROLOGYTERMS\" > \"NONPHARMAINTERVENTIO\" > \"SURVEILLANCETERMS\" > \"ETHICSTERMS\" > \"COUNTRIES\" > \"EARTHSCIENCETERMS\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correlation Extraction\n",
    "The Correlation Extraction module uses the [Pearson correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient) to compute pairwise correlations between entities identified by the Annotator. To compute the pair-wise correlation for a pair, I used the standard Pearson correlation expression. These probability values are estimated from the corpus. I experimented with computing pair-wise correlations using different text spans: sentence, paragraph, section and article. Based on my evaluation, I found that the correlations computed at the paragraph level were best at striking a balance between precision and recall. I used these associations to build the basic system. Here, the biological entities are the nodes and the pair-wise correlations are represented using undirected weighted edges where the edge weight corresponds to the correlation strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Network Augmentation\n",
    "The correlation-based network was further augmented with additional inferred novel links using a graph convolution based technique. These links have no co-occurrence-based support from the corpus. However, such novel links are equally crucial in identifying important drugs, genes etc.,for the drug development, repurposing and vaccine development tasks. I had previously developed a graph convolution-based association inferencing algorithm [GCAS (Graph Convolution based Association Scoring)](https://bmcmedgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12920-018-0372-8) in the context of network-based study of rare-diseases. My approach was motivated by the recent progress in [spectral graph convolutions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.11702.pdf), where association inferencing is viewed as a multi-step signal propagation over the network by convolving the network with a filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the primary goals of this project is to provide a high quality and a user-friendly network-based abstraction of the given corpus to explore interesting connections between several entity types. However, capturing novel connections are equally crucial for identifying useful targets for drugs and vaccines. We believe that to achieve this, we need to go beyond the provided corpus and consider the complete MEDLINE and other data sources. Our network augmentation task is a step in this direction. My final framework would thus capture highly relevant relations from COVID-19 related corpus and would also mine for additional novel associations from the whole of MEDLINE. Both these knowledge bases are then combined to complement each other so as to amplify the signal and to reduce the overall noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I have combined these knowledge bases (networks) in a simple manner. However, future submissions would provide enhancements to improve the overall quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## RESULTS\n",
    "I now describe how this network can be used to answer some of the questions posed in the challenge using a network exploration and PyVis visualization approach."

The network nodes correspond to the biological entities and the edges correspond to the associations. The edges are weighted where the edge weight denote the strength of association (correlation strength in this network) between the entity pair. The inferred associations from MEDLINE are also included in the network with additional flags. The entities span a comprehensive set of entity types, namely HUMAN_GENE, GENE_SARS, GENE_MERS, GENE_COVID, PHENOTYPE, CHEMICALS, DRUGS, DISEASE, SYMPTOM, GOPROC, GOFUNC, GOLOC, CELLTYPE, TISSUE, ANATOMY, ORGANISM, COUNTRIES, ETHICS TERMS, NON-PHARMA INTERVENTION, SURVEILLANCE TERMS, VACCINE TERMS, VIROLOGY TERMS and EARTH SCIENCE TERMS.\n",
    "\n",
    "The network is compatible with the NetworkX package. User can identify a network node (biological entity) either by its \"term name\" or the entity ID in its source DB The ID here is its public ID as present in the public data source from which its source dictionary was built. For instance, the Human Gene dictionary was built using HGNC. Hence, in order to query for \"ACE2\", one could either search using the the common term name \"ACE2\" or its HGNC ID \"HGNC:13557\". We have listed the public data sources for each of the entity types which would help the user to figure out the entity ID/term name to be used for querying. There are few terms in the dictionaries that are inserted manually. These terms can be searched only by the term name. Furthermore, dictionaries for COUNTRIES, ETHICS TERMS, NON-PHARMA INTERVENTION, SURVEILLANCE TERMS, VACCINE TERMS, VIROLOGY TERMS and EARTH SCIENCE TERMS have been built from public sources as well as with some manual updates specifically for this CORD19 challenge. Hence, searching the network for these entity types can be done preferably through querying using term name rather than IDs as few of the network entities have only internal IDs and no public IDs.\n",

    "An important aspect to be noted is the absence of normalization when building this network, resulting in a potential bias. This is because the provided corpus is highly specific to \"COVID-19\" disease articles. Though the associations are extracted based on co-occurrences of the entities in these articles, their association strength could be biased due to the limited nature of the corpus. In the subsequent releases, we would be broadening the scope of the network and also be incorporating weight normalizations based on a more comprehensive collection of articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In future, associations from high quality and heterogeneous curated data with sufficient coverage can be considered for augmenting the network derived solely from text-mining. These could be from sources such as [IntAct](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14681455). Of course, experiments would need to be done to analyse the effects of addition of such curated associations to text-mined associations in these kinds of networks.\n"
